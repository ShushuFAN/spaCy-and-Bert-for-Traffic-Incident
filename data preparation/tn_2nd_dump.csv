(2) the public vehicles unit at admiralty will continue to suspend counter services. members of the public can submit their applications for public vehicle licences using the drop-in box placed at the hong kong licensing office from 9am to 5am from monday to friday. the td will process the applications according to established procedures and deliver the respective licences/permits/approval letters to the applicants upon completion of processing such applications. (3) the vehicle records office, the driving licence records office and the driving offence points office at admiralty will continue to suspend counter services. those with enquiries relating to the collection of a driving licence after a disqualification period should contact the driving licence records office or the driving offence points office from 9am to 5pm from monday to friday. (4) the cross boundary unit at sheung wan will continue to suspend counter services. members of the public can submit their applications using the drop-in box placed at the cross boundary unit from 9am to 5pm from monday to friday. the td will contact individual applicants to follow up on the applications. as part of the anti-epidemic work, the td has required all staff to wear masks and requested the cleaning contractors to step up cleaning at all offices. the ventilation in the waiting halls of the offices will also be increased to maintain air circulation there. in addition, in view of public health considerations, starting from march 2, members of the public entering the aforesaid offices have to undergo on-the-spot body temperature checks arranged by the td. any member of the public whose body temperature is higher than 37.5degrees celsius or who refuses to undergo a body temperature check will be denied entry into the offices. the offices will also request members of the public to clean their hands with alcohol-based sanitiser before entering the offices. in order to reduce the risk of spreading the virus while queuing at the offices, the td again appeals to members of the public to submit applications when the validity period of the licences/permits is about to expire, if there is no urgent need. for enquiries, members of the public can contact the offices concerned of the td at the following numbers: hong kong licensing office 2804 2636 kowloon licensing office 2150 7728 kwun tong licensing office 2775 6835 sha tin licensing office 2606 1468 public vehicles unit 2804 2574 driving licence records office 2804 2596 driving offence points office 2804 2594 cross boundary unit 2543 2114 ",latest arrangements on td services,,,updated,,

3400,2020-04-30 12:30:00,"latest arrangements on transport department services  to align with the announcement by the government that public services will resume under a phased approach from may 4, the latest arrangements of the td's services for the public as follows:  driving test and related services ------------------------------------  driving test (road test) services will be resumed on may 4. candidates who have been scheduled to take a road test on or after that day should attend the test according to the test date, time and the driving test centre specified in the driving test appointment letter. candidates affected by the suspension of the driving test centres will be notified individually by post of their rescheduled test dates.   driving test (written test part a) and taxi written test services are planned to resume on may 26. candidates affected by the suspension of the written test services will be rescheduled to take the tests from may 26 and thereafter and will be notified individually by post of their rescheduled test dates.   per anti-epidemic measures to reduce the risk of the spread of the virus, all candidates participating in the driving test (including road test and written test) must wear surgical masks inside the test centres and throughout the test, clean their hands with alcohol sanitisers before entering the centre office, and must undergo body temperature screening arranged by the td. if a candidate does not wear a surgical mask, refuses to undergo a body temperature screening, or whose body temperature is higher than 37.5 degrees celsius, the candidate will not be allowed to enter the test venue and the test will be rescheduled. in order to improve air circulation inside the vehicle compartment, the driving examiners of the td may open the vehicle windows during the road test.   the td urges candidates not to attend a driving test if they are unwell, and advises that they should consult a doctor promptly. for applicants who are absent from a driving test on medical grounds, they may submit their postponement applications with the original sick leave certificate/medical certificate to the driving test appointment office of the td within one month from the test date for the rescheduling of the test date.   candidates who would like to apply for a postponement/temporary cancellation of a driving test appointment or change of driving test region may submit the original of the signed application letter, a copy of identification document and the original driving test appointment letter via the drop-in box placed at the kowloon licensing office or by post to the driving test appointment office (address: transport department, 2/f, cheung sha wan government offices, 303 cheung sha wan road, kowloon).   application of driving test appointment services for fresh candidates and repeaters (including walk-in counter service, online booking service for driving test appointments and telephone booking service for repeater early test appointments) will continue to be suspended until further notice. for enquiries, please contact the driving test appointment office at 2771 7723.   vehicle examination services --------------------------------  the td’s vehicle examination centres will resume full vehicle examination services on may 4.   licensing and related services ---------------------------------  the td's licensing offices, public vehicles unit, cross boundary unit, vehicle records office, driving licence records office and driving offence points office will continue to process applications submitted by applicants with scheduled appointments, via the drop-in boxes, by post or online (except for the direct issue of a full hong kong driving licence). members of the public may submit applications via the drop-in boxes placed at the offices concerned between 9am and 5pm from monday to friday (except public holidays). applicants who have made an appointment online for renewal of a full driving licence/vehicle licence, an application for transfer of ownership of a vehicle or an application for an international driving permit can visit the licensing office concerned at the scheduled time. as a continued measure of maintaining social distancing to reduce the risk of spreading the virus, the offices concerned will continue to suspend walk-in counter services.   the td will continue to closely monitor the development of the epidemic situation and align with the government's anti-epidemic measures and arrangements. normal arrangements for licensing and related services will be resumed in full only when public health conditions permit. should there be any adjustment to the services in the interim, we will notify the public in due course. to avoid unnecessary delays, the td appeals to the public to submit licence renewal applications two to three weeks before the expiry dates. besides, to facilitate timely

5369,2020-07-19 20:56:00,"transport department's latest service arrangements ****************************************** to align with the special work arrangements announced by the government to reduce the risk of the spread of covid-19 in the community, the transport department (td) said today (july 19) that it will adjust public services from july 20 until further notice. details are as follows: licensing and related services --------------------------------- (1) the licensing offices at admiralty, cheung sha wan, kwun tong and sha tin will suspend walk-in counter services, but all staff of the licensing offices will continue to work at full strength to process applications submitted by applicants with online appointments and submitted by drop-in boxes, by post, or online. during the suspension of walk-in counter services, the daily quota for online appointment of counter services for renewal of full driving licence/ vehicle licence, transfer of vehicle ownership or application for international driving permit will be increased daily from the current 4 500 to 9 000 to cater for the service need of the public. the opening period of 10 weeks for online appointments will be maintained to enable members of the public to make early appointments to visit the licensing offices. members of the public without prior booking may submit applications by post or online, or via the drop-in boxes placed at the licensing offices from 9am to 5pm from monday to friday. those submitting an application by post or via drop-in box should put the completed application form, all necessary documents and the appropriate fee (by crossed cheque payable to either ""the government of the hong kong special administrative region"" or ""the government of the hksar"") into an envelope. original identity documents and cash must not be sent by post or drop-in box. the td appeals to members of the public in need to use the online appointment services as far as possible. for applications submitted via the drop-in boxes, members of the public are advised to mark on the envelope the vehicle registration marks and the expiry dates of the vehicle licences, and to leave contact telephone numbers on the application forms. this is to enable the staff to identify and follow up on urgent applications. moreover, for timely processing of applications, members of the public should ensure that the respective application form is duly completed and all necessary supporting documents and a crossed cheque with the correct amount of payable fee are attached before submission. to avoid unnecessary delays, members of the public should submit applications two to three weeks before the expiry dates as far as practicable. (2) the public vehicles unit at admiralty will suspend walk-in counter services. members of the public can submit their applications for public vehicle licences using the drop-in box placed at the hong kong licensing office at admiralty. the td will process the applications according to established procedures and deliver the respective licences/permits/approval letters to the applicants upon completion of processing such applications.
